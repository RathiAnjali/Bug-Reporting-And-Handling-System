# Bug-Reporting-And-Handling-System
Introduction:
A company's employees can submit reports for any issues they are having using the Bug report and handling system, which serves as a single point for all complaint submissions. With the help of this application, users will be able to keep a record of every issue, irrespective of its division or type, track any responses to issues, and update others on the status of each problem.
The main goal of a Bug Reporting and Handling System is to track the progress of vulnerabilities in an application. A database contains all the discovered bugs. Each bug is given a distinct issue id and a corresponding issue status. Bugs are simple to create and edit. The application includes specific user accounts to manage access and uphold security.
